## A New Post

The [National Cancer Informatics Program](http://cbiit.nci.nih.gov/ncip/) (NCIP) supports [National Cancer Institute](http://www.cancer.gov/) research initiatives through sustaining a multidisciplinary community of biomedical researchers, informaticists, and developers dedicated to improving informatics practices in the study of cancer and the translation of that knowledge into improved clinical interventions.

A culture of openness and collaboration is critical to the mission of the NCIP for many reasons.  With the rapid evolution of high-throughput molecular assay technologies, including genome sequencing, cancer biology has become a data-intensive science and it is essential that the informatics technologies keep pace with the fast-changing, unique needs of cancer researchers.   These revolutionary advances come at a time of a shrinking NIH budget, which drives the need for efficiency and innovation.  Moreover, there is heightened demand for [reproducible research](http://www.economist.com/news/briefing/21588057-scientists-think-science-self-correcting-alarming-degree-it-not-trouble), underlining the importance of making reagents, data, and source code for scientific studies readily available to the broad scientific community.  These elements have coalesced to drive establishment of the NCIP Open-Development Initiative.

At the heart of this initiative is the [NCIP GitHub Organization](https://github.com/ncip/), which contains 135 public source-code repositories for tools developed through NCI programs. These tools support a broad range of biomedical research activities including genome sequence analysis, enterprise-wide biobanking, integration of translational research, radiologic imaging, and clinical trials management.  The vast majority of these tools are made available under a [BSD 3-Clause license](http://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause) with the intent to minimize any barriers to adapting these tools to the specific needs of any researcher or research program, academic or commercial.  An [NCIP GitHub Organization landing page](http://ncip.github.io/) generated using [GitHub pages](http://pages.github.com/) provides logical groupings so that users can more easily identify projects of interest among this rich collection of cancer-informatics resources.

Many of these projects are under active development and the most up-to-date code is available in the NCIP GitHub Organization.  We are strongly encouraging forks and pull requests.  Stay tuned for updates on this important initiative to support cancer research.
