Headed by the US Chief Information Officer, the Office of Management and Budget's Office of E-Government and Federal Information Technology was tasked by the President's Digital Strategy with drafting a comprehensive open data policy for the federal government. Such a document required collaboration among countless stakeholders, both inside the White House and across various federal agencies. Given the rapid pace of technology, the document's drafters feared that the policy could very well be outdated even as early as the day of its release.

Historically, such policy documents would be drafted using traditional desktop-publishing software, shared among stakeholders via e-mail, and ultimately published as a final and static PDF. Given the scale and pace of the undertaking, the Open Data Working Group adopted GitHub as the primary collaboration platform, not just for the policy's accompanying source code, but for the policy itself as well.

The policy was ultimately [published on GitHub](http://project-open-data.github.io/) as a living, collaborative document. Today, any federal employee or member of the public is encouraged to submit proposed improvements to the policy or any of its accompanying material. The document itself is stored as a series of Markdown files within Git, the underlying version control system which tracks and makes publicly available, a detailed history of who made what changes to the document, and is published as a free, static webpage using GitHub Pages.

To date, [more than 75 discussions and proposed changes](https://github.com/project-open-data/project-open-data.github.io/pulls) have been submitted, from [small grammatical errors](https://github.com/project-open-data/project-open-data.github.io/pull/28/files), to adding [additional resources](https://github.com/project-open-data/project-open-data.github.io/pull/21), to [a mobile-first redesign](https://github.com/project-open-data/project-open-data.github.io/pull/13) of the document. Stakeholders regularly review the feedback received and ultimately accept or reject each proposed change. The document has been updated [nearly 100 times](https://github.com/project-open-data/project-open-data.github.io/commits/master) since its release (a first for a government policy document), and the community shows no signs of slowing.
